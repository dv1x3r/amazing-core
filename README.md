# Amazing Core

Here we will try to create a custom server for the Amazing World game, which was closed in 2018.

- Game page on Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/app/293500
- Download game with Steam: [steam://install/293500](steam://install/293500)
- Discord Server: coming soon

**P.S.** I am not accepting / related to any donations as long as we do not have ready to go product and hosted server.  

## Reverse Engineering the Game

You can check some description in the /docs/intro.ipynb, or dig into the game files manually using ILSpy.

## How To Run

1. Install the game using the link above
2. Edit ServerConfig.xml : ```ServerIP = '127.0.0.1'```
3. Run Amazing Core using command line and python 3.9+ : ```python app.py```
4. Start the Game
5. Cry a lot
