# <img src="web/images/logo.png" height="75"> Amazing Core

Amazing Core is an open-source server emulator for **Amazing World**, an MMO originally developed by Ganz and shut down in 2018.
This project provides a modular, configurable framework with tools for server management, asset handling, and game services, accessible via a web-based dashboard.

## ⚠️ Warning!

Amazing Core is still in development and **not yet in a playable state** - _many_ message handlers currently return placeholder responses.

- **No multiplayer, NPCs, or quests yet**;
- **Only the intro level and the _empty_ Spring Bay map are accessible**;
- **Do not use your real username or password**;
- **Use any dummy username and password to log in**;

## 🎯 Features

- Modular architecture for game services;
- Networking protocol implementation;
- SQLite storage for simplicity and portability;
- Lightweight Web UI for server and database management;

## 🎮 Install the game

1. Visit the game SteamDB page: https://steamdb.info/app/293500/;
2. Click the **Install** button in the top right corner;
3. Install the game using Steam;
4. Navigate to the game folder and open the `ServerConfig.xml` file in a text editor;
5. Modify the server address as shown below:

If you **do not want to run a server yourself**, use the public demo server:

```xml
ServerIP = 'springbay.amazingcore.org'
```

To use your **own local server**, use the value below and proceed to the **Getting Started** section:

```xml
ServerIP = 'localhost'
```

## 🕹 In the game

- To play the intro level, click the `I'm new!` button in the main menu;
- To explore the Spring Bay, click the `Log in` button and enter any username and password;

## 🧪 Getting Started

Use this section if you want to download and run the prebuilt server - no setup or compilation required.

1. **Download** the latest [server release](https://github.com/dv1x3r/amazing-core/releases):
   - For regular Windows use `amazing-core_Windows_x86_64.zip`
   - For Apple silicon Mac use `amazing-core_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz`
2. **Extract** the archive to a folder of your choice;
3. **Download** the [blob.db](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K7k7ZHrL5KZTdsa5_BblgafPgeGWwKRc?usp=share_link) database file and place it inside the `data_db` folder;
4. **Run** the server binary;

Once started:

- The API server will be available at http://localhost:3000
- The Game server will listen on `localhost:8182`
- You can customize server settings using the `config.json`.

## 🧱 Build

To build the server from source, you will need **Go 1.24** or newer:

```sh
go build -o ./build/server ./cmd/server/main.go
```

To build and run with a single command:

```sh
go run ./cmd/server/main.go
```

You can choose between SQLite drivers by setting the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable:

- Build with `CGO_ENABLED=0` to use `modernc.org/sqlite` driver (release version);
- Build with `CGO_ENABLED=1` to use `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` driver (default);
